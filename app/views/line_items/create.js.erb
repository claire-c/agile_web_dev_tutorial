// $('#cart') tells JQuery to find the HTML element that has an id of cart.

// The content is formed by a call to the render() method on the cart object (in the crocodiles).

//The output of that method is processed by an escape_javascript() helper method, shorthand j(). It converts the Ruby string into a format acceptable as input to JavaScript.
